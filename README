PHP/CSS/JAVASCRIPT CUSTOM PORTFOLIO IN WORDPRESS 
============================================

Demo Link:

Description: 

This repository contains the files for my professional portfolio, which you can see at the link above. It integrates a little bit of jQuery, pretty much solely for the category expansion components (when you click on a [+] on the main page), and also uses CSS pretty extensively. If Drupal theming is anything like WordPress theming, which I imagine it is, then this should prove my capabilities just fine.  



Files Worth Peeking At:

/index.php -- This controls the meat of the main view, namely everything that occurs under the "Lou Alicegary" part.
/header.php -- This controls the header information, including the initial jQuery library calls and the top bar.
/footer.php -- This displays the bottom bar (the part that says "Instructional Design") and the little icons.
/single.php -- When you click on a project on the main page, this is the PHP that loads.
/headerSingle.php --Displays the headers for single.php (see above).
/style.css -- CSS styles galore. Well, not *that* many. 
/js/* -- A lot of this is jQuery and stuff I adapted from other templates. I edited a bit of it in spots to suit my needs.
